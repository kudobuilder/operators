# Operators

Collection of KUDO operators.

This is a set of KUDO operators that were developed as first community operators by the KUDO community. In the future this should be ideally split into its own repositories maintained by the operator maintainers themselves. 

This is **not** home of all KUDO community operators, that's (operators-index)(https://github.com/kudobuilder/operators-index).

## [Apache Cassandra](https://github.com/kudobuilder/operators/tree/master/repository/cassandra)

Apache Cassandra is an open-source distributed database designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.

## [Confluent REST Proxy for Kafka](https://github.com/kudobuilder/operators/tree/master/repository/confluent-rest-proxy)

The Kafka REST Proxy provides a RESTful interface to a Kafka cluster. It makes
it easy to produce and consume messages, view the state of the cluster, and
perform administrative actions without using the native Kafka protocol or
clients. Examples of use cases include reporting data to Kafka from any
frontend app built in any language, ingesting messages into a stream processing
framework that doesn't yet support Kafka, and scripting administrative actions.

## [Confluent Schema Registry for Kafka](https://github.com/kudobuilder/operators/tree/master/repository/confluent-schema-registry)

Schema Registry provides a serving layer for your metadata. It provides a
RESTful interface for storing and retrieving Avro schemas. It stores a versioned
history of all schemas, provides multiple compatibility settings and allows
evolution of schemas according to the configured compatibility setting. It
provides serializers that plug into Kafka clients that handle schema storage and
retrieval for Kafka messages that are sent in the Avro format.

## [Cowsay](https://github.com/kudobuilder/operators/tree/master/repository/cowsay)

The KUDO cowsay operator is a small demo for the KUDO [Pipe-Tasks](https://github.com/kudobuilder/kudo/blob/master/keps/0017-pipe-tasks.md).

## [Elastic](https://github.com/kudobuilder/operators/tree/master/repository/elastic)

Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.

## [First Operator](https://github.com/kudobuilder/operators/tree/master/repository/first-operator)

This is an example operator as described in the [KUDO documentation](https://kudo.dev/docs/developing-operators/getting-started.html).

## [Apache Flink](https://github.com/kudobuilder/operators/tree/master/repository/flink)

Apache Flink® provides stateful computations over data streams.

## [Apache Kafka](https://github.com/kudobuilder/operators/tree/master/repository/kafka)

Apache Kafka® is a distributed streaming platform.

## [MySQL](https://github.com/kudobuilder/operators/tree/master/repository/mysql)

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.

## [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/kudobuilder/operators/tree/master/repository/rabbitmq)

[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) is the most widely deployed open source message broker.
The KUDO RabbitMQ Operator makes it easy to deploy and manage RabbitMQ on Kubernetes.

## [Redis](https://github.com/kudobuilder/operators/tree/master/repository/redis)

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

## [Apache Spark](https://github.com/kudobuilder/operators/tree/master/repository/spark)

Apache Spark® is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.

## [Apache Zookeeper](https://github.com/kudobuilder/operators/tree/master/repository/zookeeper)

Apache ZooKeeper is an open-source server which enables highly reliable distributed coordination.
