# Contributing Guidelines

The KUDO Operators project accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.

## Developer Certificate Of Origin

KUDO Operators requires that contributors sign off on changes submitted to kudobuilder repositories.
The [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) is a simple way to certify that you wrote or have the right to submit the code you are contributing to the project.

You sign-off by adding the following to your commit messages:

    This is my commit message

    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>

Git has a `-s` command line option to do this automatically.

    git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'

You can find the full text of the DCO here: https://developercertificate.org/

## How to Contribute to an Existing Operator

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the operator in question.
1. The operator maintainer or repository owners will respond to your issue promptly
1. If your proposed change is accepted and you haven't already done so, sign the Contributor License Agreement (see details above).
1. Fork the KUDO Operators repository, develop and test your code changes in the relevant Operator directory.
1. Submit a pull request.
