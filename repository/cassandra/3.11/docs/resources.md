# Resources

## Computable Resources

KUDO Cassandra by default requests 1.5 cpu and 4.5Gi of memory for each
Cassandra node. The default limits are 2 cpu and 4.5Gi of memory.

Those requests and limits can be tuned using the following parameters:

- NODE_CPU_MC
- NODE_CPU_LIMIT_MC
- NODE_MEM_MIB
- NODE_MEM_LIMIT_MIB
- PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_CPU_MC
- PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_CPU_LIMIT_MC
- PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_MEM_MIB
- PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_MEM_LIMIT_MIB
- RECOVERY_CONTROLLER_CPU_MC
- RECOVERY_CONTROLLER_CPU_LIMIT_MC
- RECOVERY_CONTROLLER_MEM_MIB
- RECOVERY_CONTROLLER_MEM_LIMIT_MIB

## Storage resources

By default, KUDO Cassandra uses 20GiB PV. This isn't recommended for production
use. Please refer to [production](./production.md) docs to see the storage and
compute resources recommendations.

## Kubernetes Objects

KUDO Cassandra is delivered with a specific set of features, which can be
enabled if needed. enabling those features creates more objects in Kubernetes
than default installation.

Let’s take a look at the resources created by default when doing a simple
install:

```
$ kubectl kudo install cassandra
operator.kudo.dev/v1beta1/cassandra created
operatorversion.kudo.dev/v1beta1/cassandra-<version> created
instance.kudo.dev/v1beta1/cassandra-instance created
instance.kudo.dev/v1beta1/cassandra-instance ready

$ kubectl tree instance cassandra-instance

```

### Statefulset

Statefulsets are designed to manage stateful workload in Kubernetes. KUDO
Cassandra uses statefulsets. The operator by default uses `OrderedReady` pod
management policy. This guarantees that pods are created sequentially, which
means that when the Cassandra cluster is coming up, only one node starts at a
time. Pod names are <instance-name>-node-<ordinal-index> starting from
ordinal-index 0. For example a 3 node cluster created using KUDO Cassandra
instance name cass-prod will have these pods:

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cass-prod-node-0   1/1     Running   0          101s
cass-prod-node-1   1/1     Running   0          49s
cass-prod-node-2   1/1     Running   0          8s
```

When a multi-datacenter configuration with `NODE_TOPOLOGY` is used, the pod
names include the datacenter name as well. See
[multi-datacenter](./multidatacenter.md) documentation.

### Configmaps

KUDO Cassandra generates the configurable scripts and properties used in KUDO
Cassandra operator as configmap objects.

### PodDisruptionBudget

KUDO Cassandra limits the number of pods that may be down simultaneously. For
Cassandra’s service to work without interruptions, especially when quorum-based
applications are running on top of Cassandra, we need to guarantee that the
number of replicas running is never brought below the number required for a
quorum, even temporarily. Unlike a regular pod deletion, for the KUDO Cassandra
pod eviction, the API server may reject the operation if the eviction would
cause the disruption budget to be exceeded.

### ServiceAccount / Role / RoleBinding

KUDO Cassandra creates one service account which is attached with two types of
roles. The service account is <instance-name>-sa and then the Roles are:

```
<instance-name>-node-role
<instance-name>-role
```

The node role is used by KUDO Cassandra's recovery feature which uses the
Kubernetes API to detect any deleted kubelets. It is also used to free up the
KUDO Cassandra PVC Claim Ref if that is necessary. The generic role,
`<instance-name>-role` is used by the Cassandra node bootstrap binary to update
the topology-lock configmap so it has access to the configmaps

### Secrets

KUDO Cassandra creates the TLS store credentials as a secret
<instance-name>-tls-store-credentials. Those credentials are used as
keystore/truststore credentials, when adding certificates to them. This is done
when KUDO Cassandra's SSL feature is enabled.

### Service

KUDO Cassandra creates a headless service <instance-name>-svc (ClusterIP type).
This service is used for internal access from inside the Kubernetes cluster.

```
$ kubectl get svc
NAME                     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                               AGE
cassandra-instance-svc   ClusterIP   10.0.51.69   <none>        7000/TCP,7001/TCP,9042/TCP,7200/TCP   26m
```

The service exposes the storage port on 7000 by default and on 7001 if SSL is
enabled. The native transport defaults to port 9042, and metrics are exposed via
port 7200 by default.

The `RPC` port is disabled by default and can be enabled using the parameter
`START_RPC=true`, which will expose the RPC port on 9160 by default. All above
information can be exposed via custom ports using the parameters:

```
STORAGE_PORT
SSL_STORAGE_PORT
NATIVE_TRANSPORT_PORT
RPC_PORT
```

### ServiceMonitor

KUDO Cassandra integrates with prometheus-operator by default. The
ServiceMonitor uses the labels kudo.dev/servicemonitor and kudo.dev/instance to
discover the Cassandra pods.

To disable monitoring, users can start KUDO Cassandra with the parameter
`PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_ENABLED=false`. Read more information about monitoring in
the [Monitoring](./monitoring.md) section
