| **SSTABLE_PREEMPTIVE_OPEN_INTERVAL_IN_MB**               | When compacting, the replacement opens SSTables before they are completely written and uses in place of the prior SSTables for any range previously written.

| **JVM_OPT_FORCE_DEFAULT_INDEXING_PAGE_SIZE**             | To disable dynamic calculation of the page size used when indexing an entire partition (during initial index build/rebuild). If set to true, the page size will be fixed to the default of 10000 rows per page.                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
