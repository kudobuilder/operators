# KUDO Kafka Concepts

KUDO Kafka is a Kubernetes operator built on top of [KUDO](http://kudo.dev) and requires KUDO

#### KUDO Kafka CRDs

There are three CRDs that are installed when deploying KUDO Kafka:

- Operator: the definition that describes the Kudo Kafka operator.
- OperatorVersion: the definition that describes the Kudo Kafka operator for a specific version.
- Instance: the instantiation of a KUDO Kafka cluster based on the OperatorVersion.

#### KUDO Controller Reconcile Cycle

The KUDO controller continually watches the Operator, OperatorVersion and Instance CRDs via the Kubernetes API.

When a user installs KUDO Kafka using the `kudo-cli`, the controller creates the KUDO Kafka CRDs for Operator, OperatorVersion and Instance. More information can be read in [KUDO Architecture](https://kudo.dev/docs/architecture.html#architecture-diagram)

When the KUDO Controller detects a new `Instance`, it creates all the resources required to reach the desired state of the configuration.

The same process is followed for any updates or deletions. Everything is handled by the KUDO Controller.
